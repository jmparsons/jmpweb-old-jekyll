## About

JMParsons is founded by web developer and designer Jonathan M. Parsons. Jon has a strong background in art and design with a vast portfolio including sketches, drawings, and 3D rendered computer generated images. Along with a talent for the visual, Jon is an equally competent and capable developer and programmer. His work includes programming in several different languages, optimizing site performance and maintenance, and developing new and dynamic tools, which enhance the functionality of a site and a user's browsing experience.

In an increasingly competitive field, Jon has managed to stay well ahead of the curve by continuously learning and cultivating his passion for design and development. He has a thorough understanding of modern web design and function as well as creating and developing coding methods for optimum performance. Clients can expect JMParsons to deliver a website, IT tools, and enterprise solutions from inception to launch and maintenance.
